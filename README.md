# Do music charts still matter in the streaming age? An analysis predicting Beyoncé’s Spotify numbers using a regression model.

## Paper Overview

Music charts are a powerful marketing tool. This paper analyzes the number of Spotify streams of a Beyoncé song based on the number of weeks it spent on the *Billboard Hot 100* utilizing data collected from Spotify and Billboard. In our negative binomial regression model, we find that the number of Spotify streams of a Beyoncé song increases as its duration on the *Billboard Hot 100* increases. Our discovery highlights the relevance of charts in shaping today’s music business industry.
